# OpenGL Exercise 1

- A.
Draw a wire
-
frame sphere by calculating all the vertex positions and drawing lines 
between them.
- B.
For the
sphere, work out the surface normal direction
1
and augment your wire
-
frame 
drawing with short lines representing the normal direction of each vertex The sphere 
should now appear to be a 
hedgehog
.
- C.
Use the nor
mal information calculated in (b
) above work out
the amount of 
illumination falling on each vertex. Assume that the light source is at infinity and is 
co
-
axial with the viewpoint.
Use this to draw a shaded
sphere.
- D.
Develop a simple animation showing a number of cones and spheres moving along 
regular path
s. These can be wireframe or solid.
- E.
Draw
a textured object, suc
h as a rec
tangle
(plane)
, box or sphere
